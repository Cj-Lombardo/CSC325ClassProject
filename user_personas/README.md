# User Personas Directory

This directory contains detailed user personas that represent the target users of our software. These personas help team members understand and empathize with our users' needs, goals, behaviors, and pain points.

## Purpose

The user personas stored here serve multiple functions:
- Guide product decisions by considering how different user types might interact with features
- Provide context for UX/UI design choices
- Help prioritize feature development based on user needs
- Ensure consistent understanding of our target users across the development team

## Using These Personas

When working on new features or modifications, developers should:
- Review relevant personas to understand how changes might impact different user types
- Consider accessibility needs and technical expertise levels described in the personas
- Reference specific personas in technical discussions and documentation
- Use persona scenarios to validate design decisions

## Persona Structure

Each persona file includes:
- Demographic information and background
- Technical proficiency level
- Goals and motivations
- Pain points and frustrations
- Typical usage scenarios
- Key needs and preferences

## Contributing

When adding or updating personas:
- Use the provided template in `_template.md`
- Include relevant research data that informed the persona
- Keep information concise but detailed enough to be actionable
- Update the main index when adding new personas

Remember that personas should evolve as we learn more about our users through feedback and usage data.
